=============

Inspired by [this blogpost](https://hackernoon.com/lesser-known-git-commands-151a1918a60#.20ur4yxb9),

# Installation

Checkout this repo and run the `install.sh` script.

# Which commands are getting installed?

Have a look at the `install.sh` script for the actual commands, but here's a short overview:

`git it` initializes repo and creates empty root commit

`git ss` shows a short status

`git please` push --force-with-lease

`git commend` commit by amending last commit w/o editing

More commands will be added.
